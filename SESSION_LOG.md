## Conversation History

### Session 1 - 2025-10-02

#### 1. Session Log Creation
**User Request**: Generate file to keep track of our work and conversations so we can continue after restart

**Action Taken**: Created this SESSION_LOG.md file to track:
- Project state and structure
- Work completed
- Pending tasks
- Technical decisions
- Known issues

#### 2. Automated Tracking Setup
**User Request**: Automatically update this file as we build

**Action Taken**: Established pattern for milestone-based logging. Will update this file:
- After completing each major task
- When making significant changes
- Before committing code
- At user request

**Note**: Updates will be manual at key milestones since background automation isn't possible in this environment.
