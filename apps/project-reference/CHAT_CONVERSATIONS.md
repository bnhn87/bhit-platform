## üóìÔ∏è Session: [Date] - Project Sweep Analysis

### Summary
Complete architectural analysis of BHIT Work OS project to identify alignment issues and improvement opportunities.

### Key Findings
- **96 TypeScript errors** requiring fixes
- **Security vulnerabilities** in dependencies (xlsx package)
- **Component duplication** issues (StatusPill, DrawingsTab)
- **1,613 console statements** needing proper logging
- **3,586 TODO/FIXME comments** requiring attention

### Decisions Made
1. **Prioritize security fixes** - Address xlsx vulnerability immediately
2. **Standardize authentication** - Choose single Supabase client pattern
3. **Component consolidation** - Merge duplicate components
4. **Database schema sync** - Apply missing migrations

### Actions Taken
- Created comprehensive project analysis
- Identified critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Developed priority-based fix checklist
- Documented architectural insights and patterns

### Next Steps
1. Review findings with team
2. Begin critical fixes (security, TypeScript errors)
3. Plan component refactoring approach
4. Schedule dependency updates
